# Peer Review 1

Find your name in the table below. The GitHub repo of the person you should
review is linked in the "Review" column. You can view the repository online or
clone it to your computer. If you have any problems with access, email Nick.

Write 0.5 to 1 page that answers the following:

* What were three things you thought the person did well?

* What were three things you thought they could improve upon? How?

Please be polite and respectful. Your criticism should be constructive and
loosely based on what we've learned in class. Consider how well the person's
report holds your interest, how clear their analysis is, and how easy it is to
understand their graphics.

Save your write-up as a PDF file. Email a copy to the person whose report you
reviewed, and push a copy to GitHub in your __Assignment 4 repository__. The
review is due by Thursday, __May 12th__ 11:55pm.
